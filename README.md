# GitHub Contribution Streak Maintainer

This repository automatically maintains my GitHub contribution streak by making meaningful daily commits.

## Features

- Makes 20+ valid commits per day to ensure GitHub contribution recognition
- Creates unique, timestamped files for each commit
- Maintains a detailed contribution log
- Tracks streak statistics
- Fully automated via GitHub Actions

## Stats

- Total contributions: 0
- Current streak: 0 days
- Longest streak: 0 days

## How It Works

1. A GitHub Action runs daily at a scheduled time
2. The script creates meaningful file changes (not empty commits)
3. Changes are committed and pushed to the repository
4. Your GitHub profile shows a green contribution box for the day

## Files

- `daily_contribution.py`: Main script that makes the contributions
- `contribution_log.md`: Detailed log of all contributions
- `contribution_data.json`: Tracks contribution statistics
- `streak_stats.json`: Tracks streak information

## Manual Trigger

You can manually trigger a contribution by running the GitHub Action workflow from the Actions tab.

## Note

This repository follows GitHub's contribution guidelines by making actual file changes rather than empty commits.
